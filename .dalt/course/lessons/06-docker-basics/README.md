# Lesson 06: Docker Basics

## The Problem Docker Solves

You've been running DALT.PHP with `php artisan serve`. That works on your machine. But what happens when a teammate clones the project?

- Their machine has PHP 7.4, yours has PHP 8.2 — code breaks
- You installed the `pdo_pgsql` extension, they didn't — database fails silently
- You're on macOS, they're on Windows — file paths behave differently

The classic phrase: **"it works on my machine"**. Docker makes that phrase obsolete.

With Docker, you describe your exact environment in a file. Docker builds it the same way on every machine — your laptop, your teammate's laptop, a server in Germany. Same PHP version, same extensions, same OS layer, every time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What Docker is and why PHP developers need it
- The difference between a container and a virtual machine
- How images, containers, and layers relate
- The core Docker CLI commands you'll use every day
- How Docker will change the way you run DALT.PHP

## Containers vs Virtual Machines

Both solve the "different environment" problem, but differently.

**Virtual Machine:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Your Application        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│       Guest OS (Ubuntu)         │  ← full operating system
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│          Hypervisor             │  ← VMware, VirtualBox
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│    Host OS (your machine)       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
A VM runs an entire operating system. It's heavy — 10–20 GB per VM, takes minutes to boot.

**Container:**
```
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│  DALT.PHP│ │ Postgres │ │  Nginx   │  ← your apps
├──────────┴─┴──────────┴─┴──────────┤
│         Docker Engine             │  ← thin layer
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│        Host OS (your machine)     │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```
Containers share the host OS kernel. They only package what's different: your app, its dependencies, config. This makes them:
- **Lightweight** — megabytes, not gigabytes
- **Fast** — starts in milliseconds, not minutes
- **Portable** — same container runs anywhere Docker is installed

The tradeoff: containers are OS-level isolated, not hardware-level. For PHP web apps, containers are always the right choice.

## The Three Core Concepts

### Images

An image is a read-only template — the recipe. It contains:
- A base OS layer (usually Alpine Linux, ~5MB)
- Runtime (PHP 8.2-FPM)
- Your app code and dependencies

Images are built from a `Dockerfile`. They're stored in registries (Docker Hub, GHCR).

```bash
# Download the official PHP 8.2 FPM image from Docker Hub
docker pull php:8.2-fpm-alpine

# List images on your machine
docker images
```

### Containers

A container is a running instance of an image. You can run many containers from the same image — they're isolated from each other.

```
Image: php:8.2-fpm-alpine (read-only)
    ↓  docker run
Container 1: running DALT.PHP (read/write layer on top)
Container 2: running another PHP app (separate read/write layer)
```

### Layers

Images are built in layers. Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` creates a layer. Layers are cached — if a layer hasn't changed, Docker reuses it from cache. This makes rebuilds fast.

```
Layer 4: COPY . .                (your source code — changes often)
Layer 3: RUN composer install    (dependencies — changes occasionally)
Layer 2: RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo  (extensions — rarely changes)
Layer 1: FROM php:8.2-fpm-alpine (base image — almost never changes)
```

**Key insight:** put things that change less frequently at the bottom. Docker rebuilds from the first changed layer downward.

## Core CLI Commands

These are the commands you'll use constantly. Learn these and you can do everything else.

### Working with Images

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull php:8.2-fpm-alpine

# Build an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory
docker build -t dalt-php .
# -t names the image "dalt-php"
# .  means "use the Dockerfile in the current directory"

# List all images on your machine
docker images

# Remove an image
docker rmi dalt-php
```

### Running Containers

```bash
# Run a container (downloads image if not present)
docker run php:8.2-cli php -v

# Run interactively with a shell
docker run -it php:8.2-cli sh

# Run in background (detached)
docker run -d --name my-php php:8.2-fpm-alpine

# Run and remove container when it stops
docker run --rm php:8.2-cli php -r "echo phpversion();"
```

### Managing Running Containers

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# View logs from a container
docker logs my-php

# Follow logs in real time
docker logs -f my-php

# Execute a command inside a running container
docker exec -it my-php sh

# Stop a container
docker stop my-php

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm my-php
```

### Cleaning Up

```bash
# Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune

# Remove unused images
docker image prune

# Remove everything unused (careful!)
docker system prune
```

## How Docker Will Change Your DALT.PHP Workflow

**Before Docker:**
```bash
php artisan serve
# → App runs on your machine with your PHP
# → You need php, composer, sqlite installed locally
```

**After Docker:**
```bash
docker compose up
# → App runs in a container with PHP 8.2-FPM
# → Postgres runs in a separate container
# → Nginx handles HTTP routing
# → Zero local PHP/Postgres installation required
```

The goal by the end of Phase 2 is to have DALT.PHP running entirely inside Docker with:
- An `app` container (PHP 8.2-FPM + your code)
- A `db` container (PostgreSQL 16)
- An `nginx` container (handles HTTP, proxies PHP requests to app)

## Registries

Docker Hub (`hub.docker.com`) is the default registry — like npm for Docker images.

When you run `docker pull php:8.2-fpm-alpine`, Docker:
1. Looks for `php:8.2-fpm-alpine` locally
2. If not found, downloads from Docker Hub
3. Caches it locally for future use

Images are named as `owner/name:tag`. Official images (like `php`, `postgres`, `nginx`) have no owner prefix.

```bash
# These are all the same registry, different images/tags
docker pull php:8.2-fpm-alpine    # PHP 8.2 FPM on Alpine Linux
docker pull php:8.2-fpm           # PHP 8.2 FPM on Debian
docker pull postgres:16-alpine    # PostgreSQL 16 on Alpine
docker pull nginx:alpine          # Nginx on Alpine
```

## Your First Docker Command

Before writing any Dockerfiles, verify Docker is installed and working:

```bash
# Should print Docker version
docker --version

# Run PHP inside a container — no local PHP needed
docker run --rm php:8.2-cli php -v
```

The second command:
1. Downloads `php:8.2-cli` from Docker Hub (first time only)
2. Starts a container
3. Runs `php -v` inside it
4. Outputs the PHP version
5. Removes the container (`--rm`)

**Expected output:**
```
PHP 8.2.x (cli) (built: ...)
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
```

If you see this, Docker is working correctly.

## Your Task for This Lesson

1. Install Docker Desktop if you haven't yet: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. Run `docker --version` to confirm it's installed
3. Run `docker run --rm php:8.2-cli php -v` — confirm PHP 8.2 responds from inside a container
4. Run `docker run --rm php:8.2-cli php -r "echo phpversion();"` — you're running PHP code in a container
5. Run `docker run -it --rm php:8.2-cli sh` — you're now inside a container shell. Type `exit` to leave.

You haven't written a single Dockerfile yet. But you've run PHP in an isolated container. That's the foundation.

## Key Files Going Forward

- `Dockerfile` — recipe for building your app image (you'll write this in Lesson 07)
- `docker-compose.yml` — orchestrates multiple containers (Lesson 08)
- `.dockerignore` — tells Docker what to exclude from the build context (Lesson 07)

## Common Issues

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
Docker Desktop is not running. Start it from your Applications/taskbar.

### "Port already in use"
Another process is using the port. Stop it or map to a different port with `-p 8081:80`.

### "Image not found"
Check the image name and tag at hub.docker.com. Tags are case-sensitive.

## Summary

- Docker solves the "works on my machine" problem
- **Container**: a running isolated process — lightweight, fast, portable
- **VM**: a full OS emulation — heavy, slow, overkill for web apps
- **Image**: a read-only template built from a Dockerfile
- **Layer**: one instruction in a Dockerfile; cached for fast rebuilds
- **Registry**: where images are stored (Docker Hub is the default)
- Core commands: `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker exec`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`

## Next Step

**Lesson 07: Writing Dockerfiles** — Now that you understand what Docker is, you'll write the `Dockerfile` that packages DALT.PHP into an image. Then you'll complete it yourself in the first challenge.
