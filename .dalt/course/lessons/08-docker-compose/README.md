# Lesson 08: Docker Compose

## The Problem With Running Containers Manually

In Lesson 07 you built a Dockerfile for DALT.PHP. To run it alongside Postgres and Nginx you'd need three separate `docker run` commands, each with the right flags, volumes, ports, and environment variables — and you'd have to run them in the right order every time.

Docker Compose solves this. You describe your entire stack in one file (`docker-compose.yml`), and a single command brings everything up:

```bash
docker compose up
```

One command. Three containers. Everything wired together.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the structure of a `docker-compose.yml` file
- Know the purpose of every common key: `image`, `build`, `ports`, `volumes`, `environment`, `depends_on`, `env_file`
- Know the difference between bind mounts and named volumes
- Understand how containers talk to each other by service name
- Know the daily Compose commands you'll use
- Be able to set up the full DALT.PHP stack: app + Postgres + Nginx

## The Full `docker-compose.yml` for DALT.PHP

Here is the complete file you're working toward. Every key is explained below.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - app

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

## Anatomy of the File

### `services:`

The top-level `services:` key is where you declare every container in your stack. Each entry under it is one container. The key name (`app`, `db`, `nginx`) becomes both the container name and the DNS hostname other containers use to talk to it.

### `build:` vs `image:`

```yaml
app:
  build: .        # Build from Dockerfile in the current directory
```

```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:16-alpine   # Pull this image from Docker Hub
```

`build:` — Docker builds a custom image from your Dockerfile. Use this for services you own (your PHP app).

`image:` — Docker pulls a pre-built image. Use this for off-the-shelf services (Postgres, Nginx, Redis).

### `ports:`

```yaml
nginx:
  ports:
    - "8080:80"
```

Format: `"HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT"`.

This maps port 8080 on your machine to port 80 inside the nginx container. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to reach it.

Containers don't need `ports:` to talk to each other — they already share an internal network. `ports:` is only for exposing a container to your host machine.

### `volumes:`

Two kinds of volume entries:

**Bind mount** — links a path on your host to a path inside the container. Changes on either side are immediately visible on both sides.

```yaml
app:
  volumes:
    - .:/var/www/html   # host path : container path
```

This mounts your entire project directory into the container. Edit a file on your host — the container sees it instantly. No rebuild needed during development.

**Named volume** — Docker manages the storage. Data persists when the container is stopped or replaced. Use for databases.

```yaml
db:
  volumes:
    - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

```yaml
volumes:     # Declare at the top level — Docker creates and manages this
  pgdata:
```

Postgres stores all its data at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`. Without a volume, that data is inside the container and disappears when the container is removed.

### `env_file:`

```yaml
app:
  env_file:
    - .env
```

Loads every `KEY=VALUE` line from `.env` as an environment variable inside the container. This is how DALT reads `DB_HOST`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc. — and how the Postgres image reads `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

One `.env` file can serve both. Just include all the variables both services need:

```env
# DALT.PHP database config
DB_DRIVER=pgsql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=dalt
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=secret

# Postgres container init config
POSTGRES_DB=dalt
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
```

`DB_HOST=db` — not `localhost`. Inside the Compose network, the database container is reachable at the service name `db`. This is service DNS, explained next.

### `depends_on:`

```yaml
app:
  depends_on:
    - db
```

Tells Compose to start the `db` container before `app`. **Important caveat:** this only waits for the container to start, not for Postgres to actually be ready to accept connections. In Phase 5 you'll add health checks to close this gap. For now, `depends_on` is good enough for development.

## Service DNS — How Containers Talk to Each Other

Inside a Compose stack, every service gets a hostname equal to its name. The `app` container can reach the database at `db:5432`. The `nginx` container can reach PHP-FPM at `app:9000`.

No IP addresses. No `/etc/hosts` editing. Just service names.

```
Browser → localhost:8080
    ↓
Nginx container (hostname: nginx)
    ↓ fastcgi_pass app:9000
App container (hostname: app)
    ↓ pgsql:host=db;port=5432
Postgres container (hostname: db)
```

This is why your `.env` has `DB_HOST=db` and your `nginx/default.conf` has `fastcgi_pass app:9000`. The service names are the hostnames.

## Bind Mounts vs Named Volumes

| | Bind Mount | Named Volume |
|---|---|---|
| Storage location | Your host filesystem | Docker-managed |
| Survives `docker compose down` | Yes | Yes |
| Survives `docker compose down -v` | Yes | No (deleted) |
| Use case | Source code, config files | Database data |
| Real-time sync | Yes | N/A |

For source code: use a bind mount so edits appear instantly without rebuilding.  
For Postgres data: use a named volume so data persists between restarts.

## Daily Compose Commands

```bash
# Start the stack (foreground, shows all logs)
docker compose up

# Start the stack in background
docker compose up -d

# Stop everything (containers removed, volumes kept)
docker compose down

# Stop and delete all volumes (fresh database)
docker compose down -v

# View logs from all services
docker compose logs

# Follow logs from a specific service
docker compose logs -f app

# Run a command inside a running container
docker compose exec app sh
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d dalt

# Rebuild the app image after Dockerfile changes
docker compose build app

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose up --build
```

## How DALT.PHP Connects to Postgres in Docker

When you run `docker compose up`, Compose:

1. Starts `db` first (Postgres)
2. Starts `app` (PHP-FPM) — reads `.env`, builds `pgsql:host=db;port=5432;dbname=dalt` DSN
3. Starts `nginx` (web server) — forwards HTTP to `app:9000`

DALT's `DatabaseManager` runs migrations automatically if the `users` table is missing. The first request after a fresh `docker compose up -v` will trigger migration.

To run migrations manually inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

## Your Task

Load the incomplete `docker-compose.yml` into your project:

```bash
php artisan challenge:start docker-compose-missing-services
```

The file has the `app` service but is missing `db` and `nginx`. Add them using what you learned above, then verify:

```bash
php artisan challenge:verify
```

After verifying, try the full stack:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the DALT welcome page served by Nginx, run by PHP-FPM, with Postgres running in the background.

## Common Issues

### "Can't connect to Postgres" from the app
Check `DB_HOST=db` in `.env` — not `localhost`. Inside Docker, the hostname is the service name.

### Database data disappears on every restart
You're not mounting a named volume. Add `pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data` to the `db` service.

### Nginx returns 502 Bad Gateway
PHP-FPM isn't running or `fastcgi_pass app:9000` points to the wrong service name.

### Port 8080 is already in use
Change the host port: `"8081:80"`.

## Summary

- `docker-compose.yml` describes your entire stack in one file
- `build:` builds from Dockerfile; `image:` pulls from Docker Hub
- `ports:` exposes containers to your host; containers talk to each other by service name without it
- `volumes:` — bind mounts sync host files; named volumes persist database data
- `env_file:` injects `.env` into a container's environment
- `depends_on:` controls startup order (not readiness)
- `docker compose up` starts everything; `docker compose down` stops it

## Next Step

**Lesson 09: PostgreSQL First Contact** — your Compose stack is running. Now connect to Postgres directly, explore it with `psql`, and write your first raw SQL queries.
