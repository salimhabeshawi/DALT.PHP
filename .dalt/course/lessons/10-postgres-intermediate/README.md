# Lesson 10: PostgreSQL Core

## The Gap Between Hello World and Production

In the last lesson you connected to Postgres, ran basic DDL and DML, and understood why parameterized queries are non-negotiable. That got you able to write working SQL.

This lesson covers the features you'll reach for every day once your app has real data: JOINs to combine tables, aggregations to summarize data, indexes to keep queries fast, constraints to keep data clean, and transactions to keep multi-step writes atomic.

By the end you'll be able to look at a slow query and know what to do about it.

## Learning Objectives

- Write `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` with real examples
- Use `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
- Create indexes and read `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output
- Enforce data integrity with constraints (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`)
- Wrap multi-step writes in transactions with proper `ROLLBACK` handling

## JOINs — Combining Tables

A JOIN combines rows from two tables based on a matching condition. There are two you'll use constantly.

### The tables we'll work with

DALT's users table plus a posts table you'll add:

```sql
-- users: id, name, email, password, created_at
-- posts: id, user_id, title, body, created_at
```

The relationship: each post has a `user_id` that points to `users.id`.

### INNER JOIN — only matching rows

```sql
SELECT posts.id, posts.title, users.name AS author
FROM posts
INNER JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id
ORDER BY posts.created_at DESC;
```

`ON posts.user_id = users.id` — this is the join condition. It says: match each post to the user whose `id` equals the post's `user_id`.

**What INNER JOIN does**: returns only rows where there is a match on both sides. If a user has no posts, they don't appear. If a post has no matching user (orphaned row), it doesn't appear either.

### LEFT JOIN — all left rows, NULL if no right match

```sql
SELECT users.name, COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC;
```

**What LEFT JOIN does**: returns every row from the left table (`users`), even if there's no matching row in the right table (`posts`). When there's no match, the right-side columns are `NULL`.

This is the query to use when you want "all users, and how many posts each has" — including users with zero posts. `COUNT(posts.id)` counts only non-NULL values, so users with no posts get `0`.

### When to use which

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| Only rows with data on both sides | `INNER JOIN` |
| All rows from left, with optional right data | `LEFT JOIN` |
| Posts with their author (every post has an author) | `INNER JOIN` |
| Users with their post count (some users have 0 posts) | `LEFT JOIN` |

### Common JOIN mistakes

**Wrong column in ON clause** — the single most common JOIN bug:
```sql
-- WRONG: this joins on the wrong columns
INNER JOIN users ON posts.id = users.id

-- RIGHT: the post's user_id links to users.id
INNER JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id
```

**Using INNER when LEFT was needed** — your list silently drops rows:
```sql
-- If users with no posts should appear, INNER JOIN drops them silently
INNER JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id  -- wrong for "all users + post count"
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id   -- correct
```

---

## Aggregations — Summarizing Data

Aggregation functions collapse many rows into one number.

```sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM users;

-- Count non-NULL values in a specific column
SELECT COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count FROM posts;

-- Count distinct values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_authors FROM posts;

-- Sum, average, min, max
SELECT
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(amount) AS avg_order,
    MIN(amount) AS smallest_order,
    MAX(amount) AS largest_order
FROM orders;
```

### GROUP BY — aggregate per group

`GROUP BY` splits rows into groups before aggregating. One output row per group.

```sql
-- Post count per user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS post_count
FROM posts
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY post_count DESC;
```

When you `GROUP BY`, every column in `SELECT` must either be in the `GROUP BY` or wrapped in an aggregation function. This is the rule:

```sql
-- WRONG: name is neither aggregated nor grouped
SELECT user_id, name, COUNT(*) AS post_count
FROM posts
GROUP BY user_id;

-- RIGHT: join users and group by both id and name
SELECT users.id, users.name, COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC;
```

### HAVING — filter after aggregation

`WHERE` filters rows before grouping. `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.

```sql
-- Only users with more than 5 posts
SELECT users.name, COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name
HAVING COUNT(posts.id) > 5
ORDER BY post_count DESC;
```

Use `WHERE` for row-level conditions, `HAVING` for aggregate conditions.

## Indexes — Keeping Queries Fast

An index is a data structure that lets Postgres find rows without scanning the whole table. Without one, every query that filters by a column scans every row — called a **sequential scan**. On a small table this is fine. On a million-row table it kills performance.

### When to add an index

Add an index when you repeatedly query or sort by a column:

```sql
-- You run this query often:
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 42;

-- Add an index on posts.user_id:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_posts_user_id ON posts(user_id);
```

```sql
-- Searching users by email is common:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';

-- Index on email:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### EXPLAIN ANALYZE — reading the query plan

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` shows you what Postgres actually does to execute a query, plus how long it took.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 42;
```

**Before an index** you'll see something like:
```
Seq Scan on posts  (cost=0.00..24.00 rows=5 width=68) (actual time=0.012..0.089 rows=5 loops=1)
  Filter: (user_id = 42)
  Rows Removed by Filter: 495
```

`Seq Scan` = sequential scan = reads every row. `Rows Removed by Filter: 495` = 495 rows were read and discarded to find 5 matching rows.

**After adding the index**:
```
Index Scan using idx_posts_user_id on posts  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=5 width=68) (actual time=0.013..0.017 rows=5 loops=1)
  Index Cond: (user_id = 42)
```

`Index Scan` = Postgres used the index to jump directly to matching rows. Much faster on large tables.

### Index tradeoffs

Indexes speed up reads, but slow down writes slightly (because the index must be updated too). Don't index every column — only columns you filter or sort by frequently. Primary keys and foreign keys should almost always be indexed.

---

## Constraints — Keeping Data Clean

Constraints enforce rules at the database level. They're cheaper than application-level validation because the database enforces them even if your PHP code has a bug.

### NOT NULL

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- must always have an author
    title TEXT NOT NULL,         -- no empty titles
    body TEXT,                   -- body can be NULL (draft posts)
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### UNIQUE

```sql
-- Only one row per email
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

-- Or as a separate constraint (useful for composite uniqueness):
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON users(email);
```

### CHECK

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    amount NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'paid', 'cancelled'))
);
```

A `CHECK` constraint rejects any row that doesn't satisfy the condition.

### FOREIGN KEY with cascade

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

`REFERENCES users(id)` — the `user_id` column must point to a real `users.id`. You can't insert a post with a `user_id` that doesn't exist.

`ON DELETE CASCADE` — when a user is deleted, all their posts are deleted automatically. Without this, trying to delete a user with posts would throw an error.

---

## Transactions — Atomic Multi-Step Writes

A transaction groups multiple SQL statements so they either all succeed or all fail together. Without transactions, a crash between two related writes leaves your data in a corrupt state.

### The classic example: transferring credits

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE users SET credits = credits - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- deduct from sender
UPDATE users SET credits = credits + 100 WHERE id = 2;  -- add to receiver

COMMIT;
```

If anything fails between `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`, call `ROLLBACK` instead. The database resets to its state before `BEGIN` — as if neither UPDATE happened.

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE users SET credits = credits - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- imagine an error happens here...

ROLLBACK;  -- both updates are undone
```

### The bug that corrupts data

The most dangerous pattern: committing the first write before checking if the second one succeeds.

```sql
-- DANGEROUS: no transaction
UPDATE users SET credits = credits - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- committed immediately
-- server crashes here
UPDATE users SET credits = credits + 100 WHERE id = 2;  -- never runs
-- result: 100 credits vanished
```

Without `BEGIN`, each statement auto-commits. The first deduction is permanent even if the second fails.

### In PHP with PDO

```php
$pdo = $db->getConnection();

try {
    $pdo->beginTransaction();

    $db->query(
        'UPDATE users SET credits = credits - :amount WHERE id = :id',
        ['amount' => $amount, 'id' => $fromId]
    );

    $db->query(
        'UPDATE users SET credits = credits + :amount WHERE id = :id',
        ['amount' => $amount, 'id' => $toId]
    );

    $pdo->commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    $pdo->rollBack();
    http_response_code(500);
    echo json_encode(['error' => 'Transfer failed']);
    exit;
}
```

The `catch` block is non-negotiable. Without it, an exception during the second query leaves the transaction open and the data in an indeterminate state.

### Isolation levels (conceptual)

Postgres supports multiple isolation levels that control what concurrent transactions can see. The default is `READ COMMITTED` — each statement sees only committed data from other transactions. That's correct for 99% of use cases.

`SERIALIZABLE` makes transactions behave as if they ran one at a time (no interleaving), which prevents subtle race conditions at the cost of performance. You'll encounter this if you build a ledger or inventory system. For now, the default `READ COMMITTED` is what you need.

## Hands-On: JOINs, Aggregations, and EXPLAIN

Connect to your Compose Postgres container:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d dalt
```

First, create a posts table (if it doesn't exist yet):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Insert some test data (use real user ids from your users table):

```sql
-- List your users first
SELECT id, name FROM users;

-- Insert posts for the first two users
INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, body) VALUES
    (1, 'First post', 'Hello world'),
    (1, 'Second post', 'More content'),
    (2, 'Another user post', 'Their content');
```

Now run these queries and observe the results:

```sql
-- All users with post count (LEFT JOIN includes users with 0 posts)
SELECT users.name, COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC;

-- Only users who have posts (INNER JOIN)
SELECT users.name, COUNT(posts.id) AS post_count
FROM users
INNER JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC;

-- Posts with author name
SELECT posts.title, users.name AS author, posts.created_at
FROM posts
INNER JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id
ORDER BY posts.created_at DESC;
```

Check the query plan before adding an index:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1;
```

Add the index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_posts_user_id ON posts(user_id);
```

Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` again and compare. On a small dataset the difference is subtle — the real impact shows up at scale.

---

## Summary

- `INNER JOIN` — matching rows only; `LEFT JOIN` — all left rows, NULL on no match
- The ON clause must reference the correct foreign key: `posts.user_id = users.id`, not `posts.id = users.id`
- `GROUP BY` collapses rows into groups; every non-aggregated column must be grouped
- `HAVING` filters after aggregation; `WHERE` filters before
- Indexes speed up reads on large tables — use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to confirm they're being used
- `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY` enforce integrity at the DB level
- Transactions: `BEGIN` + `COMMIT` for success, `ROLLBACK` in the `catch` block for failure

## Next Steps

- **Lesson 11: DALT Database Layer** — wire these queries into DALT controllers, add pagination, handle transactions from PHP
- **Challenge: db-broken-join** — fix a JOIN query that uses the wrong join type and wrong ON clause
- **Challenge: db-broken-transaction** — add `ROLLBACK` to a transfer endpoint that currently corrupts data on failure
