# Lesson 12: Docker Intermediate

## Why Your Image Is Too Big

You've built a working Dockerfile. It installs Composer, copies source files, and starts PHP-FPM. It runs. But here's the problem: your final image probably contains Composer itself, `git`, and a bunch of build-time tools that have absolutely no business being in production.

Check the size of a naïve PHP image built with Composer installed directly:

```bash
docker images | grep myapp
# myapp   latest   ...   420MB
```

A production PHP-FPM image should be around 80–120MB. The rest is dead weight that enlarges your registry storage, slows your CI pipeline, and expands your attack surface.

Multi-stage builds fix this.

## Learning Objectives

- Write a two-stage Dockerfile that separates `build` from `runtime`
- Add `HEALTHCHECK` so Docker knows when a service is actually ready
- Use `condition: service_healthy` in Compose so containers wait for each other properly
- Understand Docker's network model at the DNS level
- Back up a named volume without stopping any containers
- Write a `.dockerignore` that keeps your images clean

## Multi-Stage Builds

A multi-stage build uses multiple `FROM` blocks in one Dockerfile. Each `FROM` starts a fresh layer chain. You can `COPY --from=<stage>` to pull files from a previous stage into the current one. The final image is built from only the last stage.

Here's the pattern for DALT.PHP:

```dockerfile
# ---- Stage 1: builder ----
# Uses composer:2, which has PHP + Composer pre-installed
FROM composer:2 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only what Composer needs first — layer caching wins here
COPY composer.json composer.lock ./
RUN composer install --no-dev --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader

# ---- Stage 2: runtime ----
# Starts fresh from a minimal PHP-FPM image — no Composer here
FROM php:8.2-fpm-alpine AS runtime

WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Install the OS packages and PHP extensions the app needs
RUN apk add --no-cache curl \
 && docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_pgsql

# Pull ONLY the installed vendor directory from the builder stage
# Composer itself stays in the builder — it never reaches the runtime image
COPY --from=builder /app/vendor ./vendor

# Copy application source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 9000

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD php-fpm -t || exit 1

CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

### What changed and why

| Single-stage | Multi-stage |
|---|---|
| Composer binary in final image | Composer stays in `builder` |
| `composer install` in runtime layer | `vendor/` copied as a static directory |
| One thick layer chain | Thin runtime layer chain |
| ~400MB image | ~90MB image |

The runtime image never sees `composer`, `git`, or any build tooling. If someone gets RCE inside the container, they can't use Composer to pull more code.

### Layer caching with multi-stage

The caching strategy still applies inside each stage. Copy `composer.json` and `composer.lock` before the application source so that a code change doesn't re-run `composer install`:

```dockerfile
# In builder stage:
COPY composer.json composer.lock ./
RUN composer install --no-dev --no-interaction  # ← cached unless composer files change

COPY . .                                        # ← app source, changes every commit
```

---

## HEALTHCHECK

`HEALTHCHECK` lets Docker periodically test whether a service inside a container is actually working, not just running. A container can be "running" (process alive) but the service inside it can be broken.

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD php-fpm -t || exit 1
```

Flags:
- `--interval=30s` — run the check every 30 seconds
- `--timeout=5s` — if the check takes longer than 5 seconds, treat it as a failure
- `--start-period=10s` — don't count failures during the first 10 seconds (let the service boot)
- `--retries=3` — mark unhealthy only after 3 consecutive failures

For a Postgres service in Compose, use `pg_isready`:

```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:16-alpine
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 10s
```

Check health status at any time:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container-id>
# healthy
```

---

## `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`

`depends_on: db` (without a condition) starts the `app` container as soon as the `db` container's process starts. Postgres takes a few seconds to initialize its data directory. Your PHP app will try to connect during that window and fail.

The fix: combine `HEALTHCHECK` on the `db` service with `condition: service_healthy` in the `app` service:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy   # ← waits for pg_isready to pass
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Now `app` only starts once `pg_isready` returns healthy. No more connection-refused errors on first boot.

---

## Docker Networking in Compose

When you run `docker compose up`, Compose creates a private bridge network and attaches all services to it. Each service gets a DNS name equal to its service name.

So from inside the `app` container:

```bash
# These are the same:
ping db         # resolves to the db container's IP
ping nginx      # resolves to the nginx container's IP
```

This is why your `.env` has `DB_HOST=db` instead of `DB_HOST=localhost` or an IP address. The service name is the hostname.

Inspect networks:

```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect daltphp_default
```

You'll see a list of containers, their IPs, and their DNS aliases on the network.

## Volume Backups Without Downtime

Named volumes persist data between `docker compose down` runs. But they're not automatically backed up. Here's how to snapshot a running Postgres volume without stopping anything:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v pgdata:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  busybox \
  tar czf /backup/pgdata-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /data
```

What this does:
- Spins up a throwaway `busybox` container
- Mounts the `pgdata` volume at `/data`
- Mounts the current directory at `/backup`
- Runs `tar` to compress `/data` into `/backup/pgdata-20240101.tar.gz`

To restore:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v pgdata:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  busybox \
  tar xzf /backup/pgdata-20240101.tar.gz -C /
```

Run this while the `db` container is stopped if you need a clean restore.

---

## `.dockerignore`

Just as `.gitignore` keeps files out of git, `.dockerignore` keeps files out of the build context. Without it, every `COPY . .` sends your entire working directory — including `vendor/`, `.git/`, and log files — to the Docker daemon. That slows the build and inflates the image.

Create `.dockerignore` at the project root:

```
# Dependencies — rebuilt by Composer in the builder stage
vendor/

# Git history — never needed in an image
.git/
.gitignore

# Logs and caches
storage/logs/*.log
*.log

# SQLite databases used locally but not in Docker
database/*.sqlite

# Development-only config
.env.local
.env.testing

# Node.js tooling (not used at runtime)
node_modules/
npm-debug.log

# IDE config
.vscode/
.idea/
```

After adding `.dockerignore`, run:

```bash
docker build -t myapp . --no-cache
```

Watch how much faster the build context upload step is.

## Summary

| Concept | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| Multi-stage build | Smaller, cleaner runtime image with no build tools |
| `HEALTHCHECK` | Docker tracks real service health, not just process state |
| `condition: service_healthy` | App waits for Postgres to actually be ready |
| Service DNS in Compose | Containers talk to each other by name, not IP |
| Volume backup with busybox | Snapshot a live volume without downtime |
| `.dockerignore` | Smaller build context, faster builds, no secrets in image |

## Your Task

Load the broken Dockerfile:

```bash
php artisan challenge:start docker-missing-multistage
```

The Dockerfile is single-stage and installs Composer directly into the runtime image. Convert it to a multi-stage build:

1. Add a `builder` stage using `FROM composer:2 AS builder`
2. Run `composer install` in the builder stage
3. In the runtime stage, use `COPY --from=builder /app/vendor ./vendor` instead of running Composer
4. Add a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction to the runtime stage
5. Remove the `COPY --from=composer:2 /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer` line — it belongs in the builder, not runtime

Verify:

```bash
php artisan challenge:verify
```

## Next Steps

- **Challenge: docker-missing-multistage** — convert a single-stage Dockerfile to multi-stage with a HEALTHCHECK
- **Lesson 13: PostgreSQL Advanced** — window functions, CTEs, JSONB, and full-text search
