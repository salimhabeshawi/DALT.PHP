# Lesson 15: PostgreSQL Reliability

## Keeping Your Data Safe

A database is only as good as its backup and its ability to evolve without breaking. In this lesson, we cover logical backups with `pg_dump`, how migrations actually work under the hood, and how to design a reliable background worker using Postgres.

## Learning Objectives

- Backup and restore a Postgres database using `pg_dump` and `psql`
- Understand how "migrations as code" are tracked in the database
- Fix broken migration states
- Build a concurrent job queue using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

---

## Backups with `pg_dump`

Docker volumes keep data safe across container restarts, but if you drop a table or the underlying server disk dies, the volume is gone. You need logical backups (SQL dumps) exported to another location.

### Manual Backup

Run `pg_dump` against the running Postgres container:

```bash
docker exec -it myapp-db-1 pg_dump -U postgres dalt > backup_2024.sql
```

This generates a plain-text SQL file containing all `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, and `CREATE INDEX` statements needed to recreate the database from scratch.

### Manual Restore

To restore, pipe the SQL file into `psql`:

```bash
cat backup_2024.sql | docker exec -i myapp-db-1 psql -U postgres dalt
```
*(Notice the use of `-i` instead of `-it` because we are piping data in, not opening an interactive terminal.)*

### Automated Backups in Compose

In production, you don't run commands manually. You add a backup service to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  backup:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    volumes:
      - ./backups:/backups
    environment:
      - PGHOST=db
      - PGUSER=postgres
      - PGPASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db_password
    secrets:
      - db_password
    # Run pg_dump every night at 3 AM
    command: >
      sh -c "while true; do
        sleep $$(expr 86400 - $$(date +%s) % 86400 + 10800);
        pg_dump -Fc -f /backups/dump_$$(date +%Y%m%d).custom dalt;
      done"
```
*(Note: In a real system you'd use a dedicated cron container like `ofelia` or push to S3, but this shows the concept.)*

## Migrations as Code

If you manually run `CREATE TABLE` in production, you will eventually forget to run it on staging, or another developer won't have it locally.

**Migrations as code** solves this. You write SQL files with numbered prefixes, and a script runs them in order.

### How DALT tracks migrations

DALT.PHP has a built-in migration system (`php artisan migrate`). Here is exactly what it does:

1. It ensures a table named `migrations` exists:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS migrations (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       migration VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       batch INTEGER NOT NULL,
       executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```
2. It looks in `database/migrations/` for all `.sql` and `.php` files.
3. It queries the `migrations` table: `SELECT migration FROM migrations`.
4. It subtracts the executed migrations from the files on disk.
5. It runs the missing files in alphabetical order.
6. After each file succeeds, it inserts a record into the `migrations` table.

### Dealing with Migration Failures

If `002_create_posts.sql` has a syntax error halfway through, it fails.
- If it wasn't wrapped in a transaction, the first half of the file executed, but the file name wasn't recorded in the `migrations` table.
- When you run `php artisan migrate` again, it will try to run `002` from the beginning, and fail because "table already exists".

**The Fix:**
Always write idempotent migrations (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). If you can't, wrap the migration in a transaction:
```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN dob;
COMMIT;
```

## Job Queues in Postgres (`SKIP LOCKED`)

When you need to send 1,000 emails, you don't do it in the HTTP request. You insert 1,000 rows into a `jobs` table, return 200 OK, and let a background worker process them.

### The Problem: Race Conditions

If you have 3 worker containers running, and they all do this:

```sql
-- Worker 1, 2, and 3 run this at the exact same millisecond:
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 1;
```

They will all select Job ID #1. All three workers will send the same email.

### The Solution: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

Postgres provides a mechanism specifically for building queues.

```sql
SELECT * FROM jobs 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND available_at <= NOW()
ORDER BY created_at ASC
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 1;
```

- `FOR UPDATE`: Locks the returned row so no other transaction can modify it.
- `SKIP LOCKED`: If another worker already locked Job #1, don't wait for the lock to release — just skip it and grab Job #2 immediately.

This allows you to run 50 concurrent workers safely against a single Postgres table.

## End-of-Phase Project: PostgreSQL Job Queue

You're going to build the queue described above.

### Step 1: The Schema

Create `database/migrations/004_create_jobs_table.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
    attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    available_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    locked_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    failed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for the worker query
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_worker ON jobs (status, available_at, created_at);
```

### Step 2: The API (Producer)

Create endpoints in `routes/routes.php` and their controllers:

- `POST /jobs` — Insert a new job. Payload should be JSON.
  ```php
  $db->query(
      'INSERT INTO jobs (type, payload, available_at) VALUES (:type, :payload, NOW() + interval \'1 second\' * :delay)',
      ['type' => 'email', 'payload' => json_encode(['to' => 'test@test.com']), 'delay' => 0]
  );
  ```

- `GET /jobs/stats` — Return counts grouped by status.
  ```sql
  SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM jobs GROUP BY status;
  ```

### Step 3: The Worker (Consumer)

Create a CLI script `worker.php` in the project root. This script loops forever, grabbing jobs and processing them.

```php
<?php
// worker.php
require __DIR__ . '/framework/bootstrap.php';
$db = \Core\App::resolve(\Core\Database::class);

echo "Worker started...\n";

while (true) {
    $pdo = $db->getConnection();
    $pdo->beginTransaction();

    try {
        // 1. Grab and lock exactly one job
        $job = $db->query(
            "SELECT * FROM jobs 
             WHERE status = 'pending' AND available_at <= NOW()
             ORDER BY created_at ASC
             FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
             LIMIT 1"
        )->find();

        if (!$job) {
            // No jobs available. Rollback the (empty) transaction, sleep, and try again.
            $pdo->rollBack();
            sleep(2);
            continue;
        }

        // 2. Mark it as processing
        $db->query(
            "UPDATE jobs SET status = 'processing', locked_at = NOW(), attempts = attempts + 1 WHERE id = :id",
            ['id' => $job['id']]
        );
        $pdo->commit(); // Release the lock so other workers don't block

        echo "Processing job {$job['id']} of type {$job['type']}...\n";

        // 3. DO THE ACTUAL WORK HERE (e.g., send the email)
        $payload = json_decode($job['payload'], true);
        sleep(1); // Simulate work

        // 4. Mark as completed
        $db->query(
            "UPDATE jobs SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = :id",
            ['id' => $job['id']]
        );
        echo "Job {$job['id']} completed.\n";

    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // 5. If it fails, mark as failed
        if ($pdo->inTransaction()) {
            $pdo->rollBack();
        }
        if (isset($job)) {
            $db->query(
                "UPDATE jobs SET status = 'failed', failed_at = NOW() WHERE id = :id",
                ['id' => $job['id']]
            );
        }
        echo "Job failed: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    }
}
```

Run it in your terminal: `php worker.php`
In another terminal, curl `POST /jobs` and watch the worker pick it up.

### Step 4: Dockerize the Worker

Add the worker to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  worker:
    build: .
    command: php worker.php
    restart: on-failure
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
```

Now you have a production-grade, concurrently-safe job queue backed entirely by Postgres.

## Your Task

Load the broken challenge:

```bash
php artisan challenge:start db-migrations-disorder
```

You have two migration files, but they are numbered incorrectly. The `posts` table (which has a foreign key to `users`) is trying to run *before* the `users` table is created.

Additionally, the `posts` table is using SQLite `AUTOINCREMENT` syntax instead of Postgres `BIGSERIAL`.

1. Rename the files so `users` runs before `posts`.
2. Fix the Postgres syntax in the posts migration.

Verify:

```bash
php artisan challenge:verify
```
